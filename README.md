## 🚀 What is PayLink?

PayLink is a **privacy-first, fully offline** utility for Android that lets anyone generate a standard UPI payment URI and a custom-styled QR code in seconds. No accounts. No servers. No tracking. Just open it, enter your UPI ID, set an amount, and share.

Whether you're a street vendor, a freelancer, or just splitting a bill — PayLink makes requesting payments as fast as unlocking your phone.

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **Zero network dependency** — no data ever leaves your device during normal use
- **No accounts, no analytics, no ads** — ever
- QR matrix computation and payment history are entirely on-device
- Update checker pings the GitHub API only when *you* tap the button — never automatically

### ⚡ Instant QR Generation
- Generates standard `upi://pay` URIs compliant with all major UPI apps (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, etc.)
- High error-correction Level H QR codes with a custom **indigo palette** and centered brand logo
- Quick-preset amount chips (₹10, ₹50, ₹100, ₹500…) for zero-keyboard speed

### 📤 Smart Sharing
- Securely exports the generated QR bitmap via Android `FileProvider` — no temp file leaks
- One-tap share directly to **WhatsApp** or any installed app via the native Android share sheet
- Optionally include the raw UPI deep-link alongside the image

### 📋 Local Payment History
- Saves every generated request to a local **SQLite** database (no ORM — native `SQLiteOpenHelper`)
- Browse and re-fill past transactions instantly from the history sheet
- Keeps the last 50 entries, sorted by recency

### 🎨 Premium UI
- Built top-to-bottom with **Jetpack Compose**
- Animated ambient background gradients that drift softly across the screen
- Shimmer border effect on the QR result card
- Polished About screen with developer info, support link, and inline update checker

### 🔄 Lightweight Update Checker
- Taps the **GitHub Releases API** on demand to compare `tag_name` against the current build constant
- Fully **F-Droid compliant** — no proprietary update frameworks, no Firebase, no Play Services
- Shows a green download CTA with the exact new version tag if an update is found
- Gracefully handles timeouts and network errors with a retry prompt

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Kotlin |
| UI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 |
| QR Engine | ZXing Core |
| Database | Native SQLite (`SQLiteOpenHelper`) |
| Async | Kotlin Coroutines + `StateFlow` |
| Image Sharing | `FileProvider` |
| Update Checking | GitHub REST API v3 (tag-based) |
| Build Environment | AndroidIDE (on-device) |

## 🏗️ Building Locally

PayLink is optimized to compile in [AndroidIDE](https://androidide.com) directly on your Android device, but it works equally well in Android Studio on a desktop.

### Prerequisites
- Android SDK 26+
- Kotlin 1.9+
- Gradle 8+

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ankush-das444/paylink.git
cd paylink

# 2. Open in AndroidIDE or Android Studio

# 3. Sync Gradle and resolve dependencies

# 4. Build the debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# 5. Install on a connected device
./gradlew installRelease
```

### Dependencies (`build.gradle`)

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.8.2"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material3:material3:1.2.1"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:1.6.4"
    implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose:2.7.0"
    implementation "com.google.zxing:core:3.5.3"
}
```

> **Note:** PayLink intentionally avoids Room, Hilt, and other annotation-processor-heavy libraries to maintain compatibility with AndroidIDE's on-device compilation pipeline.

## 🔄 Update Checker — How It Works

The update checker is deliberately minimal and transparent:

1. User taps **"Check for Updates"** on the About screen
2. App makes a single `GET` request to `https://api.github.com/repos/Ankush-das444/paylink/releases/latest`
3. Parses the `tag_name` field from the JSON response
4. Compares against the `CURRENT_VERSION` constant baked into the build
5. If they differ → shows a green **"Download vX.Y.Z"** button pointing to the GitHub Releases page
6. If they match → shows **"You're up to date!"**
7. On any network failure → shows **"Couldn't check — tap to retry"**

No telemetry. No background jobs. No scheduled checks. The internet is only touched when the user explicitly asks.
